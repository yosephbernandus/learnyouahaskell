head takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically its first element.

tail takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a list’s head.

last takes a list and returns its last element.

init takes a list and returns everything except its last element.

length takes a list and returns its length, obviously.

null checks if a list is empty. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. Use this function instead of xs == [] (if you have a list called xs).

reverse reverses a list.

take takes a number and a list. It extracts that many elements from the beginning of the list. Watch.

drop works in a similar way, only it drops the number of elements from the beginning of a list.

maximum takes a list of stuff that can be put in some kind of order and returns the biggest element.

minimum returns the smallest.

sum takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.

product takes a list of numbers and returns their product.

elem takes a thing and a list of things and tells us if that thing is an element of the list. It’s usually called as an infix function because it’s easier to read that way.

cycle takes a list and cycles it into an infinite list. If you just try to display the result, it will go on forever so you have to slice it off somewhere.

repeat takes an element and produces an infinite list of just that element. It’s like cycling a list with only one element.

Although it’s simpler to just use the replicate function if you want some number of the same element in a list. replicate 3 10 returns [10,10,10].

fst takes a pair and returns its first component.

snd takes a pair and returns its second component. Surprise!

A cool function that produces a list of pairs: zip. It takes two lists and then zips them together into one list by joining the matching elements into pairs. It’s a really simple function but it has loads of uses. It’s especially useful for when you want to combine two lists in a way or traverse two lists simultaneously. Here’s a demonstration.

Int stands for integer. It’s used for whole numbers. 7 can be an Int but 7.2 cannot. Int is bounded, which means that it has a minimum and a maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the maximum possible Int is 2147483647 and the minimum is -2147483648.

Integer stands for, er … also integer. The main difference is that it’s not bounded so it can be used to represent really really big numbers. I mean like really big. Int, however, is more efficient.

Float is a real floating point with single precision.

Double is a real floating point with double the precision!

Bool is a boolean type. It can have only two values: True and False.

Char represents a character. It’s denoted by single quotes. A list of characters is a string.

Tuples are types but they are dependent on their length as well as the types of their components, so there is theoretically an infinite number of tuple types, which is too many to cover in this tutorial. Note that the empty tuple () is also a type which can only have a single value: ()


ghci> :t head  
head :: [a] -> a

That means that a can be of any type

Functions that have type variables are called polymorphic functions. The type declaration of head states that it takes a list of any type and returns one element of that type.

ghci> :t fst  
fst :: (a, b) -> a

fst takes a tuple which contains two types and returns an element which is of the same type as the pair’s first component

Note that just because a and b are different type variables, they don’t have to be different types. It just states that the first component’s type and the return value’s type are the same

ghci> :t (==)  
(==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool


the => symbol. Everything before the => symbol is called a class constraint. We can read the previous type declaration like this: the equality function takes any two values that are of the same type and returns a Bool. The type of those two values must be a member of the Eq class (this was the class constraint).

The Eq typeclass provides an interface for testing for equality. Any type where it makes sense to test for equality between two values of that type should be a member of the Eq class. All standard Haskell types except for IO (the type for dealing with input and output) and functions are a part of the Eq typeclass.

The elem function has a type of (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool because it uses == over a list to check whether some value we’re looking for is in it.


Eq is used for types that support equality testing. The functions its members implement are == and /=. So if there’s an Eq class constraint for a type variable in a function, it uses == or /= somewhere inside its definition. All the types we mentioned previously except for functions are part of Eq, so they can be tested for equality.

Ord is for types that have an ordering.

ghci> :t (>)  
(>) :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Bool


ghci> "Abrakadabra" < "Zebra"  
True  
ghci> "Abrakadabra" `compare` "Zebra"  
LT  
ghci> 5 >= 2  
True  
ghci> 5 `compare` 3  
GT

Members of Show can be presented as strings. All types covered so far except for functions are a part of Show. The most used function that deals with the Show typeclass is show. It takes a value whose type is a member of Show and presents it to us as a string.

ghci> show 3  
"3"  
ghci> show 5.334  
"5.334"  
ghci> show True  
"True"

Read is sort of the opposite typeclass of Show. The read function takes a string and returns a type which is a member of Read.

ghci> read "True" || False  
True  
ghci> read "8.2" + 3.8  
12.0  
ghci> read "5" - 2  
3  
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" ++ [3]  
[1,2,3,4,3]

ghci> :t read  
read :: (Read a) => String -> a

It returns a type that’s part of Read but if we don’t try to use it in some way later, it has no way of knowing which type. That’s why we can use explicit type annotations. Type annotations are a way of explicitly saying what the type of an expression should be. We do that by adding :: at the end of the expression and then specifying a type. Observe:

ghci> read "5" :: Int  
5  
ghci> read "5" :: Float  
5.0  
ghci> (read "5" :: Float) * 4  
20.0  
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" :: [Int]  
[1,2,3,4]  
ghci> read "(3, 'a')" :: (Int, Char)  
(3, 'a')

Enum members are sequentially ordered types — they can be enumerated. The main advantage of the Enum typeclass is that we can use its types in list ranges. They also have defined successors and predecessors, which you can get with the succ and pred functions. Types in this class: (), Bool, Char, Ordering, Int, Integer, Float and Double.

ghci> ['a'..'e']  
"abcde"  
ghci> [LT .. GT]  
[LT,EQ,GT]  
ghci> [3 .. 5]  
[3,4,5]  
ghci> succ 'B'  
'C'


Bounded members have an upper and a lower bound.

ghci> minBound :: Int  
-2147483648  
ghci> maxBound :: Char  
'\1114111'  
ghci> maxBound :: Bool  
True  
ghci> minBound :: Bool  
False

Num is a numeric typeclass. Its members have the property of being able to act like numbers. Let’s examine the type of a number.

ghci> :t 20  
20 :: (Num t) => t

It appears that whole numbers are also polymorphic constants. They can act like any type that’s a member of the Num typeclass.

ghci> 20 :: Int  
20  
ghci> 20 :: Integer  
20  
ghci> 20 :: Float  
20.0  
ghci> 20 :: Double  
20.0  

Those are types that are in the Num typeclass. If we examine the type of *, we’ll see that it accepts all numbers.

ghci> :t (*)  
(*) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a

It takes two numbers of the same type and returns a number of that type. That’s why (5 :: Int) * (6 :: Integer) will result in a type error whereas 5 * (6 :: Integer) will work just fine and produce an Integer because 5 can act like an Integer or an Int.

To join Num, a type must already be friends with Show and Eq.

Integral is also a numeric typeclass. Num includes all numbers, including real numbers and integral numbers, Integral includes only integral (whole) numbers. In this typeclass are Int and Integer.

Floating includes only floating point numbers, so Float and Double.

A very useful function for dealing with numbers is fromIntegral. It has a type declaration of fromIntegral :: (Num b, Integral a) => a -> b. From its type signature we see that it takes an integral number and turns it into a more general number. That’s useful when you want integral and floating point types to work together nicely. For instance, the length function has a type declaration of length :: [a] -> Int instead of having a more general type of (Num b) => length :: [a] -> b. If we try to get a length of a list and then add it to 3.2, we’ll get an error because we tried to add together an Int and a floating point number. So to get around this, we do fromIntegral (length [1,2,3,4]) + 3.2 and it all works out.

Notice that fromIntegral has several class constraints in its type signature. That’s completely valid and as you can see, the class constraints are separated by commas inside the parentheses.
